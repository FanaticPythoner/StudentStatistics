PowerPoint presentation of the StudentStatistics software I made, allowing teacher to grade students performance on 3 levels (green, yellow, red), get statistics of their classes and more. The software allows you to create and add your own classes with student, classes subject (EX. French), sub-subjects (EX. for French it could be grammar), create a project folder where all your database and data are (project that you can launch anywhere where the software is installed) and much more.
